# Project-5: Data analysis of the online video game store for 2017 campaign
### Project Description
In this project, you work for the online video game store **Ice**, which sells video games globally. Your goal is to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or fails, using data from open sources. The dataset includes various factors such as user and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g., Xbox, PlayStation), and historical game sales data. By analyzing these patterns, we aim to identify key factors that predict a game's success.

The dataset spans historical data up to 2016, with a focus on preparing for the 2017 marketing campaign. Imagine itâ€™s December 2016, and you're planning strategies for the upcoming year. The data will help you understand which factors drive sales and which platforms, genres, or markets are likely to perform well.

The dataset includes information on the **Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB)**, which assigns age ratings to games such as "Teen" or "Mature." This is another factor to consider when analyzing the potential success of a game in different markets.

By the end of this analysis, you'll be able to spot trends and patterns that can help the company optimize advertising campaigns and target the right audiences in 2017.

### Key Findings
Here are the key insights derived from the analysis:

1. **Platform Sales Trends (2012-2016)**:
   - The 'PS4' and 'XOne' platforms show strong growth.
   - The 'PS3', 'X360', and '3DS' platforms are seeing declining sales.
   - PS4 emerges as the top-performing platform in terms of total sales during this period.

2. **Genre Profitability**:
   - 'Action' is the most profitable genre, followed by 'Shooter', 'Role-Playing', and 'Sports'.
   - Niche genres like 'Puzzle' and 'Strategy' tend to perform poorly, leading to lower profitability.

3. **Correlation Between Reviews and Sales**:
   - A weak positive correlation (0.1 to 0.2) was found between user reviews and total sales, suggesting that while reviews have some influence on sales, other factors are likely more important in determining a game's success.

4. **Regional Differences**:
   - Sales trends in North America (NA) and Europe (EU) are similar, while Japan (JP) shows distinct preferences for certain genres and platforms.

5. **Statistical Analysis Results**:
   - No significant difference in user ratings between the 'Xbox One' and 'PC' platforms.
   - A statistically significant difference in user ratings between 'Action' and 'Sports' genres, indicating different audience preferences.

### Goals
The main goal of this analysis is to identify patterns that can help determine the potential success of a video game based on historical sales, platform performance, user reviews, and genre trends. These insights can inform a marketing strategy for 2017, identifying the platforms, genres, and target markets most likely to perform well.

**Key objectives include**:
- Identifying which platforms and genres are likely to succeed in 2017.
- Understanding how user and expert reviews correlate with sales performance.
- Examining regional market trends (NA, EU, JP).
- Using this analysis to plan targeted advertising and marketing campaigns for the 2017 year.

The data is available in the data/ directory of the repository.
